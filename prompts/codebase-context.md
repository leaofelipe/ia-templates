# Codebase Context

Analyze this repository from three perspectives: software architecture, development, and product.

## Objective

Generate comprehensive technical documentation in Markdown at the repository root, including Mermaid diagrams when relevant.

## Analysis Scope

### Architecture

- Tech stack and main dependencies
- Architectural patterns
- Folder structure and module organization
- Data flow and integrations
- Important architectural decisions

### Development

- Code structure and conventions
- Main modules/components and their responsibilities
- Application entry points
- Development setup (scripts, env vars)
- Tests: strategy and coverage
- Build and deployment

### Product

- Purpose and main features
- Critical user flows
- Business domain
- Public APIs/contracts

## Output Format

Organize in clear sections with:

- Mermaid diagrams for architecture, flows and dependencies
- Code snippets when necessary to illustrate patterns
- Internal links for navigation between sections

## Priorities

1. Clarity about what the code does
2. How pieces connect
3. How to start developing
4. Points of attention and complexities
