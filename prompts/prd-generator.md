# PRD Generator

## Input Problem/Opportunity

[Paste or describe the problem, feature request, or opportunity here]

## Instructions

Given a product problem or opportunity, generate a complete PRD following the PRD_TEMPLATE structure.

### Analysis Process

1. **Problem Analysis**: Clarify the core problem and its business impact
2. **User Context**: Identify affected users, their needs, and pain points
3. **Solution Design**: Define features that address the problem
4. **Success Definition**: Establish measurable business outcomes
5. **Scope Management**: Determine clear boundaries of what's included/excluded

### CRITICAL: Information Gathering

**If you lack information to complete any section:**

1. DO NOT make assumptions or fill with generic placeholders
2. STOP and ask the user specific questions about what's missing
3. List all questions clearly before proceeding
4. Wait for answers before generating the PRD

**Only generate the complete PRD after you have sufficient information.**

### Required Information Checklist

Before generating the PRD, ensure you understand:

- [ ] The problem being solved and who experiences it
- [ ] Business goals and how success will be measured
- [ ] Target users and their characteristics
- [ ] Core features needed to solve the problem
- [ ] Technical constraints or integrations required
- [ ] What is explicitly out of scope

## Output Format

Generate a complete PRD following the structure and guidance in `prd-template.md`, including:

- All sections properly filled with specific information
- User stories that reflect real user needs
- Features with clear business value
- Measurable success metrics
- Technical constraints at high level only
- Explicit non-goals
- Open questions for items needing clarification
